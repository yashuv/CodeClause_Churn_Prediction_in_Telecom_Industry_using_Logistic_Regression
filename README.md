# CodeClause_Churn_Prediction_in_Telecom_Industry_using_Logistic_Regression

This is the first project I completed as a part of my Data Science internship at **CodeClause**.

In this project, I accomplished the following:Â 

## 1. Definition of Task
Churn, in the context of churn prediction, refers to the loss of customers or clients. Churn prediction is the process of identifying which customers are likely to leave a company or stop using a product or service in the near future.

Churn prediction is often used in industries such as telecommunications, banking, and subscription-based businesses, where retaining customers is important for long-term profitability. The goal of churn prediction is to identify customers who are at risk of churning and take steps to retain them, rather than losing them as customers and having to acquire new ones.

## 2. Importing necessary libraries 
Importing library in a Python script allows you to use the functions, classes, and other objects defined in those libraries in your code and makes it easier to accomplish tasks.

For example, you might import the `numpy` library to use its array manipulation and numerical computing functions, or you might import the pandas library to use its data manipulation and analysis tools.

## 3. EDA 
It is a valuable tool for understanding and gaining insights from data. It can also be used to generate ideas for further research or to communicate findings to others.and is an important step in the data science process.

for eg: summary statistics

## 4. Exploring data using visualizations 
It is an effective way to gain insights and understand patterns and relationships in the data. It can help you to gain a better understanding of the data and identify any potential issues or problems that may need to be addressed. 

For example, a scatter plot can be used to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables, while a bar chart is useful for comparing the values of a categorical variable.

## 5. Exploring feature distributions
It is the process of understanding the distribution of values for a particular feature or variable in a dataset. This can be useful for understanding the characteristics of the data and identifying patterns and trends that may be relevant for our analysis.

## 6. Data preprocessing
It is the process of preparing data for analysis by cleaning, transforming, and selecting the relevant data. It is an important step in the data science process, as it can help to improve the quality and accuracy of the data and make it easier to analyze. Some common data preprocessing steps are:

* **Cleaning the data**: Removing errors, missing values, or duplicate records

* **Handling missing values**: Imputing missing values or removing records with missing values

* **Encoding categorical variables**: Converting categorical variables into numerical form.

* **Normalizing or scaling the data**: Transforming the data to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

* **Feature selection**: Selecting a subset of the features to include in the analysis.

## 7. Model building
It is the process of creating a mathematical or statistical model to represent the relationships and patterns in a dataset. Model building is a common task in data science and machine learning, as it allows you to make predictions or inferences about the data based on the patterns identified in the model.

There are many different types of models that can be built, including linear models, logistic regression models, decision trees, and neural networks. The choice of model will depend on the type of data and the specific goals of the analysis.

## 8. Performance evaluation
It is an important step in the model building process, as it allows you to assess the effectiveness of the model and make any necessary adjustments to improve its performance. It is also important to evaluate the performance of a model on unseen data, as this can provide a more realistic assessment of its performance on real-world tasks. Some common performance evaluation metrics are:

* **Accuracy**: The proportion of correct predictions made by the model
* **Precision**: The proportion of correct positive predictions made by the model
* **Recall**: The proportion of actual positive cases that were correctly predicted by the model
* **F1 score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall
* **AUC-ROC**: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, which measures the ability of the model to distinguish between positive and negative cases

## 9. Making predictions
It is the process of using a model to generate a prediction or estimate for a specific task or problem. It allows to make informed decisions or take specific actions.
